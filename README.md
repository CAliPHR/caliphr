# What is CAliPHR?
CQM Aligned Population Health Reporting (CAliPHR) is an open source tool that is designed to calculate eCQMs at a provider, 
practice, payment arrangement, and community level to support incentive and value-based payment programs.  

CAliPHR can calculate eCQMs from imported clinical summary documents in the [QRDA Cat I](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=35) 
or [C-CDA](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=258) format.

# What does this mean?
It was specifically designed to aggregate patient data from various health care settings across a community for eCQM 
calculations based on a complete, longitudinal view of each patient’s medical history.  The ultimate goal being to produce 
more accurate and reliable eCQM results.

Please note:  Additional technology is necessary to de-duplicate and link patient data across multiple healthcare settings.
